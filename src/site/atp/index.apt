Persistence Framework 2
  
  The Persistence Framework 2 handles the storing updating and deletion of persistent objects. It is optimized
  for Hibernate but has open Interface structure that allows you to use other data storage mechanism such as 
  direct JDBC, serialisation of the objects or writing XML Files.
